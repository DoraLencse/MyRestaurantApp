#### Restaurant Reviews

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I have to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application.

### Specification

I have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code had a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also didn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it didn’t work offline at all. My job was to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality. 

### How to run this app?

1. Download my repository. 

2. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 7800` 
For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 7800`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.


3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:7800`
